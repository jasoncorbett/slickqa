Slick is a Test Case Management system.  While it may not be there yet, it's coming along quickly.  Right now it's fully functional at
scheduling distributed automation, entering testcases (via REST api), and collecting automation results.

It is in ACTIVE use and development is going as quickly as we can.

The name came as someone looked at one of the earlier versions and said "Oooh, that's slick."  The goal is to make an open
source test case management system that doesn't suck!

I hear what your saying next, "Ok, I understand the name Slick, but why do I see SlickIJ everywhere?".  Good question.  The first version of Slick was written in python, and when the current version (2.0) started in development it was named SlickIJ for "Slick in Java" to help differentiate it.

Below are some examples of slick in action.
